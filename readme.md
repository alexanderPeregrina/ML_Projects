## ⚙️ Setting Up the Environment

To ensure reproducibility, a `requirements.txt` file is provided. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Linux/macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Once the environment is active, install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##  How to Use
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderPeregrina/ML_Projects.git
cd ML-Projects
```
- Create and activate the virtual environment.
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
- Open any Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and start experimenting.
